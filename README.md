# Helpful materials for Web-Development

!Disclaimer: in this repository files with code are created by me, but PDFs were mainly taken from somewhere on the internet. When I was getting them - none of them were described as commercial and were in a free access. I do not claim ownership over those files. If you are the owner of any of the files and want something removed - you can contact me via LinkedIn.
